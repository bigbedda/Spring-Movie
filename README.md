Why are we doing this?
I wanted to create a place to keep track of movies, who directed it, what the rating for it is and it's age. I chose movies for my project because I spent a lot of my free time watching movies and thought a way to keep track of them would be a great idea.



How I expected the project to go 
I expected the project to be very challenging, there are a lot of moving parts to make all the code connect and run the way I'd like it to
and with the connecting of MySQL and postman to test too there s a lot that could go wrong.



What went well?
All the code seemed to work when ran as a springboot app with no faults first time, the SQL connection worked right off the bat too



What didn't go as planned? 
Accidentally created my project table in a database for another project I was working on outside the course,
 Getting my project to connect with postman so I could test the create, read, update, delete, however the reason for it not working was
a very simple capital letter in the wrong place throwing the whole program off.
